1. Find total channels across all images     --> done
2. Create mask and Polygons ---> done
3. Image processing using Image Indexing
4. Create new 3 channels which can be fed directly to mask-rcnn  ----> done
5. Train a simple mask-rcnn model.



a. Change Criterion ---> Use DICE Loss or Cross-entropy Loss   ---> done
a1. Use the metric in competition for judging    ---> done
b. Wrap model in a class  ---> done      
c. Set Model for training   ---> done


1. apply albumentation to train data    ---> data
2. Use some pretext data, then fine-tune on given data  ---> the current pretext data is very poor
3. Image pre-processing... of tif channels


UNET ------->
(see table with available weights for each encoder_name)
decoder_attention_type
activation 

UNET++ -------->
Decoder of Unet++ is more complex than in usual Unet.
